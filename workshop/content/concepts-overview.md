Kubernetes
----------

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management
of containerized applications.

Knative
-------

Knative (pronounced kay-nay-tiv) extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware 
components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based 
applications that can run anywhere: onpremises, in the cloud, or even in a third-party 
data center.

Each of the components under the Knative project attempt to identify common
patterns and codify the best practices that are shared by successful,
real-world, Kubernetes-based frameworks and applications. Knative components
focus on solving mundane but difficult tasks such as:

- Deploying a container
- Routing and managing traffic with blue/green deployment
- Scaling automatically and sizing workloads based on demand
- Binding running services to eventing ecosystems
